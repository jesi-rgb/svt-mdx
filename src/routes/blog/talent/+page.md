# Talent

> **Talent**: _natural_ aptitude or skill

**talent** is usually defined, as we can see here from a quick search on google, as a natural skill or inclination some people may present when being exposed to a new discipline.

this is usually seen a good thing: it is extremely satisfying to perform well on a somewhat unknown subject, as that may indicate an innate ability that may come with some corresponding life career or direction. it feels like you are skipping the hard part. you are taking a shortcut.

clear examples of this come from kids that may unexpectedly do well on a instrument or sport. they do better than their peers and as such, they deserve more attention in the hopes that we can somehow pull a diamond from this rock.

doing well on a discipline is associated with higher levels of intelligence, since smart people find everything easier than their peers, **by definition**. it all comes down to what the context you are developing in can offer you.

that's when you see kids skipping courses --- the idea being that you are smart enough to keep up with people that are more mature than you. essentially, they've lived for longer than you, so they should know more than you. put it the other way around: you've needed less time to fully understand your environment than your peers did.

in my experience, all comes down to the concept of **learning density**. how much are you able to fit in your little head per unit of time. how fast can you become good enough at something for it to signify that you should keep devoting a significant amount of time to it.

people that have a high learning density factor learn faster. and as such, they devote more time on their craft, becoming even better --- great, if you will.

so, again, thinking about it for just a second, everything just revolves around how much time you need to learn something, and how well your surroundings do on average for it to be worth celebrating.

the other side of the spectrum is also common: people that put time into something without major improvements or lack of remarkable moments in their career. people that simply need more time. this group can feel frustrated, particularly in **comparison** to their peers that are doing better given the same time frame. this can lead to a lack of purpose and a constant poisonous questioning of one's self: _why am I doing this?_

this can lead to premature failure on the craft, if the conditions line up. some people are more resilient than others. it may take only a bit of insecurity to completely throw everthing off the window.

this would be less prominent if either of these were true: **we didn't expect greatness out of nothing** or **we didn't compare ourselves against our environment so harsly**.
