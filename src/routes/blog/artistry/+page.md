# Artistry is an act of faith

<!-- art as an act of faith -->

<!-- trust in what you believe it's good -->

<!-- taste is about experience, not _luck_ or _talent_ -->

when creating, or helping to create, we are bringing into _existence_ something that was not there before. and, in doing so, we follow paths that either others have followed and proved right, or we explore new territories and form new paths that others will follow in the future.

particularly, when helping to create, we are captains of a ship in which we now have a compainon. we know how to sail through this vast space, but we don't know where to go or what to find. our compainon _does_ know what to find, but does **not** know the way, let alone how to sail this ship.

our job as captains is to sail through this immense sea in the _hopes_ that we will eventually find what we are looking for. being able to do this quickly, reliably and consistently is what makes an artist good.

eventually, when enough work and care has been put, we reach the beloved island in which the treasure is hidden.

but this metaphor falls apart a bit for me here, because the treasure is not _found_, but rather **created**.

when enough work and care has been put, we reach the converging point in which both parts are equally satisfied.

our compainon is putting a lot of trust in the fact that if we like the result, it's because the result is good. taste is a matter of **experience**. we know what's good because we have seen lots of bad before. we know what's good because we've seen even more good before.

we pay attention to small details that are very difficult to keep track of. we pursue different goals in our sailing, even though they land on the same spot in our map. but in taking this apparently unknown path to our compainon, we are making sure that the treasure is being built properly, all things considered.

no detail is too small. and that is what our compainon is putting their trust into. the hopes that we are aiming for greatness in our craft.

things made with love and care resonate with almost every person in this world. even when you have not enough experience to have a fine tuned sense of taste. even when you may lack all the technical skills.

these factors can (and will) be developed over time. but love and care belong to our heart. art is an act of love. it is the manifestation of our love into something tangible that others can see, touch or smell.

as such, training our soul to be more empathic with those around, to be more thoughtful, to think outside our small circle and consider new possibilities is a key aspect of our artistic journey, just as important as it is to practice your scales on the piano or perfect your ability with the vector pen tool.

the ship is fueled by love. love into our craft, into the result, into the **process**.

lots of creative work don't follow these rules and paths. authors may only be pursuing money, success, or both â€” and that's **fine**. this is not defining how things work as much as it is exposing how I feel about my craft.

I just cannot **not** love what I do. otherwise I wouldn't be doing it.
